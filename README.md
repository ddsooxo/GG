## Inspiration
- Our slogan: "be a helping hand for yourself and the world"

We tried to figure out how to make a better impact on the world after the pandemic started affecting the lives of many people. When the pandemic started, many people became demotivated and many charities/non profit organizations started a decline in donors. Also, 72% of all charities are expecting a further decline in 2021.  

## What it does
Primarily focusing on the importance of charities and non profit organizations, we decided to create a simple, fun and interactive community todo/betting system. A user will be able to create and delete bets with their opponent. Users bet real money which the loser then donates to a charity of the winner's choice. It is really a win-win situation for both opponents. 

## How we built it
We built this website mainly using ReactJS and Create-React-App as a boilerplate. We tinkered with CSS and JS files to style the website. 


## Challenges we ran into

We ran into a plethora of challenges along the way -- from the ever-so-dreaded merge conflicts, to finding framework we could all work on, and even deployment. Nonetheless, our team persisted through the minor obstacles we faced. We learned that -- as a team -- we can go further and solve problems more efficiently. We turned to pair-programming when we ran into code issues. We communicated often and provided feedback on design and code. In the darkest and stressful of times, we turned to our witty humor and dad jokes to lighten up our situation. In retrospect, the challenges we faced were necessary to grow as developers and we are extremely proud of the progress we made during the weekend.


## Accomplishments that we are proud of
- We were able to accomplish several user stories - creating a bet and removing a bet, listing the blocks of bets started. 
- We also went out of our comfort zone and decided to compete in the pitching competition. 


## What we learned
- We learned how to build a website using ReactJS, create prototypes in Figma, and use gitHub. 

## What's next for GreaterGood | GG
We want to implement:
- a follow/unfollow friend feature
- sign in and sign out feature 
- sign up feature 
- view past challenges 
- implement charity donation system
